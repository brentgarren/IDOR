# IDOR

IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference

This type of vulnerability can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), too much trust has been placed on the input data, and it is not validated on the server-side to confirm the requested object belongs to the user requesting it.


Encoded IDs

When passing data from page to page either by post data, query strings, or cookies, web developers will often first take the raw data and encode it. Encoding ensures that the receiving web server will be able to understand the contents. Encoding changes binary data into an ASCII string commonly using the a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and = character for padding. The most common encoding technique on the web is base64 encoding and can usually be pretty easy to spot. You can use websites like https://www.base64decode.org/ to decode the string, then edit the data and re-encode it again using https://www.base64encode.org/ and then resubmit the web request to see if there is a change in the response.
